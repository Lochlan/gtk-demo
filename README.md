# gtk-demo

Just messing around with GTK+ 2.

Right now this is basically just the hello world program from the [GTK+ 2.0 Tutorial](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/stable/book1.html), although I'm slowly adding widgets to it and evolving it as a program, to eventually turn it into something else.
